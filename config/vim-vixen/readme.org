* Vim Vixen Config

  I just backup my config here for the Firefox extension [[https://github.com/ueokande/vim-vixen][vim-vixen]]. I change the
  default settings because I use a non-standard vim key bindings that I came up
  with for Colemak-DHm.

  I configure keymaps in the add-on’s preferences by navigating to
  ~about:addons~, selecting “Extensions”, and pasting in the backed up config.

  [[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/sync][Firefox Sync]] keeps the config synced between devices automatically.


** Config Notes

   I delete key bindings I don't think I'll ever use.

   Some of the key bindings I would use it they were dependable, but instead opt
   for the default key bindings. One example, is switching and deleting tabs.
   There are several places where vim-vixen just doesn't work due to API
   limitations.
