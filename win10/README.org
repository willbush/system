* Windows Setup

  Before installing Windows make sure the BIOS is set to UEFI only
  otherwise it might not install an EFI partition, which is annoying
  if you want to dual boot using UEFI.

  The following is basically a checklist to remind myself of the
  litany of things to do after a fresh install.

  - update windows
  - Get Firefox
  - Get Dropbox
  - Get KeepassXC
  - Sync Firefox
  - Install latest hardware drivers (e.g. graphics)
  - Install printer
  - Perhaps check for a bios update
  - Use [[https://github.com/10se1ucgo/DisableWinTracking][DisableWinTracking]]
  - Get https://gitforwindows.org/
  - clone this repo and use =mklinks= and =bloatware-remover= scripts
  - Get https://chocolatey.org/
  - Get [[https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox][Wox]]
  - Look over https://ninite.com/ for ideas of what to install
  - When dual booting set Windows to use UTC time:

    When dual booting into Linux Windows 10 has a known issue with the
    time getting messed up. To fix it, apply the registry file in this
    directory named: =RealTimeIsUniversal.reg=
