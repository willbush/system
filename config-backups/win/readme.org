* Windows Setup

  The following is basically a checklist to remind myself of the litany of
  things to do after a fresh install.

1. Update and restart windows until it's finally done

2. Maybe use https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10 (seems trusted, but not open source)

3. Get https://chocolatey.org/ I try to install things using this when I can.

   Look over https://ninite.com/ and https://chocolatey.org/packages for ideas
   of what to install. Here is a small list of things I installed after a fresh
   install:

   - 7zip
   - git
   - github-desktop
   - gopass
   - hackfont-windows
   - keepassxc
   - msys2
   - notepadplusplus
   - ripgrep
   - rufus
   - sumatrapdf.install
   - syncthing
   - synctrayzor
   - vlc

4. Install https://gnupg.org/. Note this is on chocolatey and up-to-date, but
   didn't seem to work right until I installed if from the website.

5. Setup Syncthing

6. clone this repo and use =mklinks= and =bloatware-remover= scripts

   - When dual booting into Linux Windows 10 has a known issue with the time
     getting messed up. To fix it, apply the registry file in this directory
     named: =RealTimeIsUniversal.reg=

7. Set a ~HOME~ environment variable which is used by Emacs and other things.

8. See the [[../../emacs/readme.org][Emacs readme]]

9. Install printer and latest hardware drivers (e.g. graphics)

10. Perhaps check for a bios update

11. Sync Firefox

12. Turn on "Storage Sense" in the storage settings.
