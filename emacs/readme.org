# Emacs

In NixOS I use [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]] to bootstrap files and folders under FreeDesktop
config ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME~. I use [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2][Chemacs]] as an Emacs profile switcher.

If you want to try my Emacs config the following should work:
The `default` directory has my main configuration. If you want to try it, just
copy it to `~/.emacs.d`. For example:

#+begin_src bash
[ -f ~/.emacs ] && mv ~/.emacs ~/.emacs.bak
[ -d ~/.emacs.d ] && mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
cp -a ./default ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src
