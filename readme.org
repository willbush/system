* System Configuration

  Everything needed to build my NixOS system for play and Windows for work.

** Folder Structure

*** stow

    I use =stow= for symbolic link management for configurations under the
    =stow= directory.

    I keep configurations here for things that I haven't yet migrated to nix or
    can't because it needs to run in Windows and Linux (Windows is not supported
    by nix). For example, Emacs is something I used in both Windows and Linux,
    and I haven't yet tried setting it up in cygwin or WSL where nix has a hope
    of working.

    Management with stow is easily done with:

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    stow -Rv . -t ~/
    #+END_SRC

*** nixos

    For things that are only used in NixOS are kept here.

*** win

    For things that are only used in Windows are kept here. See its [[file:win/README.org][readme]] for
    more information.
