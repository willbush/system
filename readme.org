* ❄ NixOS system and Emacs config

In NixOS, I run an [[https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence][impermanent]] setup with tmpfs as root, flakes, LUKS
encryption. Check out [[https://willbush.dev/blog/impermanent-nixos/][this blog]] post I made if you're interested.

** configs

A sort of catch all for config / non-nix code.

Some are simply configuration files that are symlinked to ~/.config/~ and managed
with [[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][home manager]].

*** keyboard firmware

Keyboard firmware code managed by Nix and the [[file:configs/keyboard-firmware/readme.org][readme]] that goes into depth on my
key layout and customized Evil / Vim keybindings.

*** emacs

My emacs configuration code. See its [[file:configs/emacs/readme.org][readme]] for more information.
