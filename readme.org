* Keyboard Firmware - Planck layout

  The [[https://olkb.com/planck][Planck]] keyboard uses [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/][qmk_firmware]] and I have my keymap code In the
  [[./nixos/keyboard-firmware/planck/]] folder. The following section describes my
  keyboard layout.

** Key aliases used below

 | Alias | Meaning         |
 |-------+-----------------|
 | C     | Ctrl            |
 | S     | Shift           |

 | RET   | Return          |
 | GUI   | Win / Super key |
 | vert  | pipe character  |
 | ===== | column spacer   |

 I use ~x/y~ to denote a key that does x when tapped and y when held. For
 example, ~RET/S~ performs return when tapped and shift when held.

** Colemak Mod-DH

   https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/

   I am using the ortho-linear variant of Colemak Mod-DH that switches the 'm'
   to the home row with the 'k' just below it. The reasoning is that 'm' is much
   more frequently used in English and easier to reach.

** Lower and Raise Commentary

   Number keys are present on both lower and raise layers to provide me the
   option to hold either layer for whatever is most comfortable.

   I have changed most of the positions of symbols. The following explains why:

   - Symbols on home row is great for programming and Vim/Evil

   - Positions in part motivated by higher frequency use being on the Lower
     layer since it is easier to delimit the symbol with spaces. I do not
     need to let go of the layer key to enter spaces when that layer key is on
     my left hand.

   - Symbols often used together kept on the same layer to avoid layer
     alternating.

   - Avoid covering ~Esc/C~ key so I have easy access to the ~Ctrl~ key.

   - Both raise and lower duplicate the ~<~ and ~>~ keys for easy access since
     these are often used in combination with other symbols. I still have these
     available in the normal positions.

   - Positions motivated by Evil symbol keys:

     I decided to mirror ~h~, ~j~, ~k~, ~l~ (Qwerty) style of Evil movement on
     the left hand with the same fingers since there are many things bound to
     symbols that have the notion of back/forward and up/down.

     Actually, the up and down positions on the left hand are mirrors of the
     right hand, but the left and right positions or spatially correct. It feels
     natural to me for the index finger to make things go down and the middle
     finger to make things go up. I used to hate these positions when I first
     started learning Vim because they weren't as natural as the ~w~, ~a~, ~s~,
     ~d~ keys. However, horizontal movement using ~h~ and ~l~ should be rare, if
     you're doing it right, and with that in mind down and up on the index and
     middle finger makes a lot of sense.

     + ~(~ and ~)~ which does back / forward a sentence in Evil bound to left /
       right positions on left hand.

     + ~{~ and ~}~ which does back / forward a paragraph in Evil bound to left /
       right positions on right hand.

     + ~[~ and ~]~ which does back / forward a section in Evil bound to left /
       right positions on left hand.

     + ~^~ and ~$~ which does a soft beginning of line / end of line in Evil
       bound to left / right positions on left hand.

     + ~+~ and ~-~ which are often associated with increasing and decreasing are
       bound to the up and down positions on the left hand.

     + ~*~ and ~#~ which does a word search forward / back in Evil bound to down
       and up positions on the right hand. I used that location because I'm out
       of left and right positions to use and searching forward/back often jumps
       down/up, which is close enough mentally for me.

     + ~!~ and ~=~ moved to home keys since their often used together and often
       used for negation.

     + ~|~ and ~\~ moved over a column to put it on the home keys. This allows
       ~Del~ to be moved below backspace, which make key combinations involving
       ~Del~ easier to hit.

     + =~= and ~`~ moved onto home keys. I mostly only used these with editing
       markdown and org files. The =~= key toggles case in Evil, but I tend to
       use ~u~ and ~U~ to do that in visual state. The ~`~ goes to a mark in
       Evil, but I rebind that to a better key.

     + ~@~ moved under right hand index finger. I often use this key along with
       ~q~ because both are involved with using Evil macros, which I use a lot.
       I initially thought to leave it close to ~q~, but double tapping ~@~ to
       replay the previous macro with my pinky finger would get old fast.

     + ~_~ has functionality in Evil I'm aware of, but never use. I only use the
       key heavily when programming in Rust due to the typical snake case style.
       The primary reasoning behind it's location is to being close to ~-~ makes
       it easier to remember where it's at since they are visually similar.

     + ~%~ jumps to a matching symbol such as a parenthesis or braces. I put it
       on the down position key despite it's behavior not exactly matching that.
       However, it's close enough for me.

     + ~&~ repeats a substitute command in Evil, but I never use it. I rebind
       this to ~evil-use-register~, which is typically on the quotation mark,
       because it's quite annoying to hold shift to hit it and then a layer to
       hit a number.

* Hacking Evil keybindings

  Switching to Colemak keyboard layout has caused me to want to customize the
  Evil/Vim key bindings from their defaults. The main motivator is the spread
  out positions of ~h~, ~j~, ~k~, and ~l~ keys.

  Most people who use Vim/Evil with Colemak either get used to the new positions
  of things or use something like an [[https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/extend.html][extend layer]] to layer movement keys over
  the positions of said movement keys. The argument is that you shouldn't be
  using those keys much anyways because there are better approaches to movement.
  In addition, using a keyboard layer makes these movement available to all
  applications outside of editors and IDEs that provide Evil emulation.

  I find these arguments unsatisfactory. I already use most of the better
  methods of movement, yet my usage of ~j~ and ~k~ remains quite high despite
  using ~{~, ~}~, ~(~, ~)~, ~C-u~, ~C-d~, and avy quite a lot. The letters ~h~
  and ~l~ for horizontal movement I use less frequently due to my usage of ~f/F~
  (find) and ~t/T~ (till) along with ~w~, ~b~, and ~e~. In addition, we can both
  rebind the motion keys and use a layer for Vim like arrow key movement in
  other applications.

  In my experience needing to up or down short distances is a common task, and a
  lot of the time I'm just perusing with no specific target or editing goal in
  mind. In addition, these keys often provide the semantic equivalent of
  movement key bindings in various Emacs packages that are not concerned with
  editing text.

  I haven't actually measured this, but I suspect the frequency of my usage of
  ~j~ and ~k~ is quite high. This is why I find the common solutions to Evil +
  Colemak unsatisfactory. The same drive to optimize things (and perhaps shave
  some Yaks) and learn Colemak is the same one that makes me want to fix this.

  Personally, I see the main downside to customizing Evil is the need to
  replicate the custom keybindings in anything else where I want to use it's Vim
  emulation. I think the Emacs package Tramp solves the issue with needing to
  ssh into a machine. And even without that, I typically have a user profile I
  could easily add a configuration file to.

  So now the question is how far do I take the customization. Even doing the
  minimal changes to get my Colemak Mod-DH (ortho-linear version) keys (~m~,
  ~n~, ~e~, ~i~) swapped with ~h~, ~j~, ~k~, and ~l~ will incur all the cons I
  mentioned above, so why not go all the way? Learning curve might be one reason
  to do a minimal fix. However, I personally don't have a problem investing the
  time to get over the learning curve for the sake of ergonomic bindings that
  make more sense.

** How to read the tables below:

 - The tables below heavily uses aliases for the sake of not having to scroll
   horizontally when viewing this in the browser (at least on my resolution
   screen).

 - The left most column named ~state~ describes modified states (i.e. holding
   Shift, Ctrl etc.), keyboard layers, and Evil states.

 - I use ~x/y~ to denote a key that does x when tapped and y when held. For
   example, ~RET/S~ performs return when tapped and shift when held.


  | Alias | Meaning           |
  |-------+-------------------|
  | C     | Ctrl              |
  | GUI   | Win / Super key   |
  | M     | Alt / Meta        |
  | RET   | Return            |
  | S     | Shift             |
  | bol   | beginning of line |
  | del   | delete            |
  | eof   | end of file       |
  | eol   | end of line       |
  | ln    | line              |
  | mk    | mark              |
  | para  | paragraph         |
  | rec   | record            |
  | rev   | reverse           |
  | rpl   | replace           |
  | scrn  | screen            |
  | sent  | sentence          |
  | subst | substitute        |
  | tgl   | toggle            |
  | vis   | visual            |

** A rough estimation of frequency

   The following table columns are numbered from high to low frequency of use
   where zero represents things I practically never use. This is my very rough

*** Things of note:

    - I never use substitute and it's on a home key. I don't even think that's a
      bad habit. I just think substitute is largely has its use-cases covered by
      more flexible commands.

    - I hardly use marks, but that's more of a bad habit that I can improve.

    - I think my frequency of usage largely depends on what I'm doing. I read a
      lot more than I write so I do a lot of navigating.

    - I use begin/end paragraph a lot more when looking at source code because
      it behaves more predictably than say in an org mode file where it might
      jump several pages past tables. Ideally I want to replace my usage of this
      with something more predictable.

    - In practice, I think I hardly ever use the next/end/prev ~WORD~ motions.
      These motions are all about skipping over symbols to get somewhere faster.
      However, when I'm moving to a location horizontally with an intention I
      typically use find/till and ~;~ to repeat.

** Custom Evil on ortho-linear Colemak-DH

   One thing that seams really apparent to me after going over an iteration of
   binding custom keys for Colemak is that many of the positions of keys got
   worse. Vim key bindings are truly designed with Qwerty in mind. Let's fix
   that.

*** Evil functionality keys before / after

    Note that absence of an attribute indicates no change. Also note that I'm
    comparing how things were in Qwerty with defaults to how they are with my
    custom key map in Colemak-DH based on my subjective opinion.

    - ~s~ :: A keybinding that remains in the same location for Colemak-DH as it
             was in Qwerty. Note table only shows swapped keys so many other
             keys remain in the same location not shown below.

    - ~+~ / ~-~ :: A keybinding moved to a better / worse location.

    - ~M~ / ~m~ :: indicates a gain of motion synergy with positions of movement keys.

    - ~N~ / ~n~ :: indicates a key moved to a more/less mnemonic position.

    - ~c~ :: indicates a key combined with another key of similar functionality.

    - ~P~ / ~p~ :: indicates a key with a gain/loss in proximity to a key of
                   similar functionality.

    - ~x~ :: indicates a key unbound because it's not used and deemed not
             useful.

    - ~d~ :: indicates a key binding duplicated to another key and the old
             binding remains intact.

**** Visual Mode key remap

     I just couldn't help but remap the visual mode key on to the home keys
     because I use it all the time. I definitely use it more than I use the
     replace functionality. In addition, notice the finger rolling action from
     ~r~ to ~s~ / ~t~ (in Colemak) to visual/range select till some character.
     If I left it where it was it would have been in a worse position compared
     to Qwerty, but now it's better.

**** Scroll up and down

     I originally rebound scroll up/down keys to ~N~ and ~E~. However, I instead
     decided to bind those keys to a custom evil motion that's equivalent to
     prefixing normal ~n~ and ~e~ movements with 10. This gives me a way to move
     up and down at a similar speed to forward/backward paragraph, but much more
     reliably. I bind scroll up/down to ~C-S-e~ and ~C-S-n~ respectively because
     it allows hold Control and Shift to move vertically quickly and release one
     modifier key to reduce speed. The ~C-n~ and ~C-e~ keys are also options,
     and are available.

*** Left half

    [[http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif][This cheat sheet]] is an influence to these tables. However, this is not as
    easy to read since it's text based and split in half. Note that many of the
    key are more nuanced than the description might lead one to believe. I also
    overlay the key-map for my Planck keyboard.
