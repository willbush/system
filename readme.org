* System Configuration

Everything needed to build my NixOS system. Note this is highly customized
configuration that's not targeting a wide audience. However, feel free to copy
and use any parts of if you like in your own configuration.

** Folder Structure

The following is 1 level deep directory structure generated using ~tree -L 1 -d~.

#+begin_src
.
├── config
├── config-backups
├── emacs
├── hosts
├── keyboard-firmware
├── modules
├── profiles
├── secrets
├── users
└── xmonad
#+end_src

*** config

Config files used in NixOS that are symlinked to ~/.config/~ and managed with
[[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][home manager]].

*** config-backups

Miscellaneous configuration files that I'm backing up and are not deployed
automatically.

*** emacs

My emacs configuration code. See its [[file:emacs/readme.org][readme]] for more information.

*** hosts

host specific configuration files.

*** keyboard-firmware

Holds my keyboard firmware code managed by Nix and the [[file:keyboard-firmware/readme.org][readme]] that goes into
depth on my key layout and customized Evil / Vim keybindings.

*** modules, profiles, and users

similar to and inspired by:
https://devos.divnix.com/index.html


*** secrets

A place for me to store encrypted secrets using [[https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt][git-crypt]].

*** xmonad

My Xmonad configuration code which is symlinked by home-manager. See its [[file:xmonad/readme.org][readme]]
for more information.

** NixOS

*** Build Custom ISO

I have a custom bootable ISO that provides a graphical environment similar to
the one in nixpkgs with a few nice to have tools and my Emacs configuration for
installing NixOS.

To build it:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/willbush/system.git
cd system
nix build ".#iso"
#+end_src

The ISO will be in the ~./result/iso~ build result folder.

*** Write Custom ISO to a USB stick

Use ~lsblk~ to determine the device and replace ~/dev/sdX~ in the example below
with your device. You should not have the device mounted before running the
following command. In addition, the exact file name will probably be different
from the example below. Also see [[https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-booting-from-usb][the manual]] on this topic for additional
information.

#+begin_src shell
sudo dd if=./result/iso/nixos-21.03.20201209.e9158ec-x86_64-linux.iso  of=/dev/sdX status=progress
#+end_src

If you're in Windows try https://rufus.ie/.

*** Install

The primary source of documentation for installing NixOS is the [[https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/][manual]]. The
following are my own notes on how I install things in various situations. I
thought about making a install script that [[https://xkcd.com/1319/][automates]] most of this for me, but it
just doesn't seem worth it with the varying use cases and low frequency of
re-formatting.

**** [[https://virt-manager.org/][Virt Manager]]

1. File > New virtual machine > Forward.
2. Choose ISO > Forward (it should auto-detect that it's NixOS).
3. Choose Memory and CPU amount (~4 CPUs and ~6148 RAM when host can afford it)
   > Forward.
4. Choose available disk size (I usually increase to 30 GiB) > Forward.
5. Check the ~Customize configuration before install~ > Forward.
6. In the Overview section consider changing the Firmware from BIOS to UEFI > Apply
7. In the Video QXL section change the model Virtio and enable 3D acceleration
   (allows increasing desktop resolution) > Apply > Begin Installation.
8. Once booted into the ISO the first thing I do is go to View > Scale Display
   Always. In addition, I increase the resolution using Display Configuration
   for plasma5.

**** Dual booting NixOS with Windows

These are my abridged notes on dual booting Windows 10 along side NixOS on a
single drive and UEFI system. The following outlines how to ensure the EFI
partition that Windows creates isn't ridiculously small, how to remove the
Recovery partition that Windows creates, and how to shrink the Primary partition
to make space for NixOS.

***** Create custom sized EFI partition that NixOS will share and Install

1. Boot into the Windows setup and select custom install.
2. Delete all partitions on the drive until only unallocated space remains.
3. Press Shift+F10 to open an elevated command prompt.
4. Open the disk partitioning tool's REPL by entering ~diskpart~.
5. Enter ~list disk~ and ~select disk n~ where n is your disk number.
6. ~create partition efi size=512~ to create a EFI system partition 512MiB.
7. ~format quick fs=fat32 label=System~
8. Enter ~exit~ twice to get out of the REPL and command prompt.
9. Select the unallocated space and hit next (it will automatically utilize the
   created EFI partition).

***** Delete Recovery partition

1. Once booted into Windows open another elevated command prompt and ~diskpart~.
2. Again enter ~list disk~ and ~select disk n~ where n is your disk number.
3. ~list partition~ and ~select partition n~ where n is the Recovery partition number.
4. ~delete partition override~ and ~exit~ twice.

***** Shrink Primary partition to make space for NixOS

1. Open the Disk management GUI application.
2. Right click on the large ~C:~ NTFS partition and shrink it to your desired size.
3. Continue with the UEFI version of the next section.

**** Basic partitioning and formatting

The following is mostly just following the manual instructions [[https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-partitioning-UEFI][here]]. However, I
switched to using =cfdisk= instead of =parted= because I've hit the [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/38164/create-partition-aligned-using-parted][misalignment
warning]] using =parted= when following the manual's instructions. Most
suggestions to fix the warning involve using percentages, but that's annoying
when you want to create 3 or more partitions. The =cfdisk= utility allows
specifying sizes and auto aligns partitions optimally.

- Note that one can wipe all the file systems on a device using ~sudo wipefs -a
  /dev/sdX~ which is useful to start over or prepare a device.

- Note your system booted in UEFI mode when ~/sys/firmware/efi/~ folder exists
  and has files in it.

***** BIOS

1. ~sudo cfdisk~
2. select dos
3. new > 2G (adjust size to your liking) > primary > type > Linux swap / Solaris.
4. Select free space > new > enter (for remaining space) > primary.
5. Write > yes > quit

****** Check alignment

At this point I like to use =parted= just to double check the alignment.

1. Open a parted REPL: ~sudo parted~
2. Print all devices to determine the device to format: ~print all~
3. Select device: ~select /dev/sda~ (Note the exact disk depends on your ~print all~ output.)
4. ~align-check optimal 1~ and repeat for ~2~ (both should output aligned)
5. ~q~ to quit.

****** Formatting

#+begin_src shell
sudo mkswap -L swap /dev/sda1
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/sda2
#+end_src

****** Mount

Mount the target NixOS file system:

#+begin_src shell
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/nixos /mnt
#+end_src

Continue to the Installation section.

***** UEFI

1. ~sudo cfdisk~
2. select gpt (if prompted)
3. new > 512M > type > EFI System (skip this step if dual booting with Windows)
4. select free space
5. new > 2G (adjust size to your liking) > type > Linux swap
6. Select free space > new > enter (for remaining space)
7. Write > yes > quit

****** Check alignment

At this point I like to use parted just to double check the alignment.

1. Open a parted REPL: ~sudo parted~
2. Print all devices to determine the device to format: ~print all~
3. Select device: ~select /dev/sda~ (Note the exact disk depends on your ~print all~ output.)
4. ~align-check optimal 1~ and repeat all partitions (all should output aligned)
5. ~q~ to quit.

****** Formatting

#+begin_src shell
sudo mkfs.fat -F 32 -n boot /dev/sda1 # Skip when dual booting Windows.
sudo mkswap -L swap /dev/sda2
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/sda3
#+end_src

****** Mount

Mount the target NixOS file system:

#+begin_src shell
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/boot /mnt/boot #by-label/SYSTEM if partition created by Windows
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/nixos /mnt
#+end_src

**** Installation

1. If you have swap, then enable it now.

   When the ~hardware-configuration.nix~ is generated it won't include an entry
   for the swap partition unless you enable it before generating the file.

   #+begin_src shell
   sudo swapon /dev/sda2
   #+end_src

2. Prepare the configuration

   #+begin_src shell
   sudo nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
   cd /mnt/etc/nixos
   sudo git clone https://github.com/willbush/system.git
   #+end_src

   For a new machine setup the new machine in ~flake.nix~ and under
   ~./system/hosts/~ using the generated ~hardware-configuration.nix~.

   Change the hashed user passwords in ~user.nix~. These hashed passwords can be
   generated with ~mkpasswd -m sha-512~.

   Disable anything else that depends on unlocking the encrypted secrets folder
   (just =syncthing= at the time of writing this).

   Be sure to stage all new files created in repository as required for flakes.

3. Install

   Replace betelgeuse in the following command with your machine name.

   #+begin_src shell
   sudo nixos-install --flake /mnt/etc/nixos/system/#betelgeuse --no-root-passwd --impure
   reboot
   #+end_src

   Notes:

   - No root password needs to be created because it should be specified in
     ~user.nix~ as a hashed password.
   - Impure flag is needed because nix thinks ~/mnt/nix/store~ as a non-store
     path.

4. Move system repository

   After booting into the newly installation, I personally prefer my system
   repository in my home directory (change the user as needed):

   #+begin_src shell
   sudo mv /etc/nixos/system ~/
   sudo chown -R will ~/system/
   #+end_src

*** Update

To update all the flake inputs:

#+begin_src shell
nix flake update
#+end_src

To up update a single input:

#+begin_src shell
nix flake update --update-input nixpkgs
#+end_src

*** Nix Repl

To open the flake in a ~nix repl~ do the following:

#+begin_src shell
nix run '.#repl'
#+end_src

*** Switch

Build and switch to the generation provided by the flake for machine / host
name:

#+begin_src shell
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake <PATH_TO_GIT_REPO>#<MACHINE>
#+end_src

For example:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/willbush/system.git
cd system
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake '.#betelgeuse'
#+end_src

The ~.~ before the ~#~ is the path to the git repository. What comes after the
~#~ is the machine / host name which can be found enumerated in the ~flakes.nix~
file.
